# SportShop
this is a basic ecommerce website(no payment options)that provides actions like add/delete/update products and signup/signin for users.
I used mongodb for storing the data,nodejs both for server and client side.
I used expressJS framework to manage server and routes.
the views in the client side is written in ejs files. 

user details for login:
e-mail: "mo@test.com"
password: 2222
